GIF created with Adobe Premier Pro.

## Notes

I didn't have many challenges while building the app but I had trouble figuring out how to implement git and GitHub.
I further had trouble with creating and uploading the gif because I didn't want to download LiceCap, I screen recorded and used Adobe premier pro but my laptop kept shutting down due to the fans running at full speed and I had to restart my laptop and upload the gif.
